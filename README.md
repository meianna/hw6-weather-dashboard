# Weather Dashboard

## Functionality

- This weather dashboard allows the user to search for weather conditions by city

- The user is presented with a current forecast including temperature (Fahrenheit), humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The user is also presented with a five-day forecast of the selected city

- The background color of of the UV index corresponds to how high or low it is. Red indicates any UV index 8 or above, blue indicates indexes between 5-7, and green indicates indexes less than 5.

- Each city searched for is prepended in a list and the user may click on any previous city to view its weather conditions

## Styling

- I kept the styling very simple using Bootstrap using cards for the current weather container as well as the forecast

- Responsive design to allow for mobile usage
